### BoltAuth
BoltAuth is a tool to retrieve bearer tokens faster, when having multiple accounts.

# How to use it?
1. Download the tool.
2. Insert your accounts into **accounts.txt**.
3. Run the program, and wait for all accounts to be checked.
4. Open **valid_accounts.txt** and there is the accounts.

And then you're set!


# NameChange Allowed
The tool doesn't have "nameChangeAllowed" feature yet. I'll add that soon.



## TODO LIST
- Add verification for NameChange
